# Based on other games
This game wouldnt be possible without the help of the community. Here are some game examples that helped us in the process of making the game:

# Use of Geckos.io
While there are other wonderful libraries like Socket.io, we found that using UDP with Geckos.io significantly reduced lag. We can't recommend this library enough!
